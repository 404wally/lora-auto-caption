## Reddit Post (r/StableDiffusion, r/civitai)

**Title:** I built a free tool that auto-captions your LoRA training images using AI

**Body:**

I got tired of spending hours manually writing captions for LoRA training, so I built something to fix it.

**LoRA Auto Caption** uses Claude AI to analyze each image and generate training-optimized captions automatically.

**How it works:**
1. Upload your training images
2. Set your trigger word (e.g., "bunnykitty character")
3. AI generates captions for each image
4. Review/edit anything you don't like
5. Export a ZIP with resized images (512/768/1024) + matching .txt caption files

That's it. Ready to upload to Civitai.

**What makes the captions good:**
- Starts with your trigger word
- Comma-separated tags (not sentences)
- Describes: pose, expression, clothing, colors, background
- Optimized for SD training

**It's free** - I'm validating whether people actually want this. If you try it, let me know what's missing or broken.
